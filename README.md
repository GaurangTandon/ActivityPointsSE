# ActivityPointsSE

I recently initiated discussion on Activity points in SE network. It was not so well received on MetaSE though. Here's the detailed [proposal](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/306872/activity-points-on-the-se-network). I still intend to make it though anyway ^\_^ Currently there's no deadline but only a future roadmap. 

**Pull requests and suggestions are welcome!**

**Future roadmap**:

1. Implement a JS bookmarktlet that when executed on a user's profile page gives their activity points
2. Implement a Chrome extension that allows displays every user's Activity points next to their rep points on their profile page (https://site.stackexchange.com/users/USER_ID/USER_NAME).
3. Extend the Chrome extension to display how a user's Activity points (aka activity) varied over time in a graph (like the [rep variation](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/5026/gaurang-tandon?tab=reputation&sort=graph&StartDate=2018-02-13%2015:06:08Z), but a line graph instead of the bars)
4. Implement a [StackApp](https://stackapps.com/) that can build Activity Point leagues for all the users on a SE site (similar to [rep leagues](https://stackexchange.com/leagues/431/alltime/chemistry))
